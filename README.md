## Overview

This Spring Boot application is a portal for managing data related to students, laptops, courses, books, and addresses. It includes CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each model and supports one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships between entities.

## Data Flow

The data flow in this application follows these major components:

- **Controllers**: Handle incoming HTTP requests and delegate to service classes.
- **Services**: Contain business logic and interact with repositories.
- **Repositories**: Interface with the database to perform CRUD operations.
- **Database**: Stores data in tables defined by JPA entity classes.
- **Data Structures**: Entity classes represent data structures.

## Controllers

- `StudentController`: Manages student-related endpoints.
- `LaptopController`: Manages laptop-related endpoints.
- `CourseController`: Manages course-related endpoints.
- `BookController`: Manages book-related endpoints.
- `AddressController`: Manages address-related endpoints.

## Services

- `StudentService`: Contains business logic for students.
- `LaptopService`: Contains business logic for laptops.
- `CourseService`: Contains business logic for courses.
- `BookService`: Contains business logic for books.
- `AddressService`: Contains business logic for addresses.

## Repositories

- `StudentRepository`: Handles database operations for students.
- `LaptopRepository`: Handles database operations for laptops.
- `CourseRepository`: Handles database operations for courses.
- `BookRepository`: Handles database operations for books.
- `AddressRepository`: Handles database operations for addresses.

## Database Design

The database design is based on JPA entity classes:

- `Student`: Represents student information.
- `Laptop`: Represents laptop information.
- `Course`: Represents course information.
- `Book`: Represents book information.
- `Address`: Represents address information.

Entities are related through one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships, as defined in the entity classes.

## Data Structure

- `Student`:
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Name
  - Age
  - Phone Number
  - Branch
  - Department
  - Address (One-to-One)
  - Courses (One-to-Many)
  - Books (One-to-Many)

- `Laptop`:
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Name
  - Brand
  - Price
  - Student (One-to-One)

- `Course`:
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Title
  - Description
  - Duration
  - Students (Many-to-Many)

- `Book`:
  - ID (Primary Key)
  - Title
  - Author
  - Description
  - Price
  - Student (Many-to-One)

- `Address`:
  - Address ID (Primary Key)
  - Landmark
  - Zipcode
  - District
  - State
  - Country

## Summary

This Spring Boot application provides a comprehensive portal for managing student, laptop, course, book, and address data. It supports various relationships between entities and offers CRUD operations for each model. The application's structure follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, with controllers handling incoming requests, services containing business logic, repositories interfacing with the database, and well-defined entity classes representing data structures.
